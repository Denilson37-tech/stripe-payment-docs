API documentation sample for Stripe payment flow.

Stripe Payment API Documentation (Sample Project)

This repository demonstrates my ability to create clear and structured API documentation.  
It is a sample project built for my technical writing portfolio and is not affiliated with Stripe.  

Project Overview

The documentation in this repo covers a simple payment workflow using Stripe’s API:

- Quickstart Guide → Step-by-step process to make your first payment request.  
- API Reference → Detailed explanation of the `POST /v1/charges` endpoint, request parameters, and responses.  
- Examples→ Realistic `curl` request to create a charge.

Why This Project?

As an aspiring API Documentation Writer, I built this project to showcase how I can:  
- Write concise and clear developer guides  
- Structure documentation logically  
- Use Markdown effectively for technical content  

 Next Steps
Future improvements to this sample project may include:  
- Adding Refund API documentation  
- Expanding to List Charges endpoint  
- Including a simple API flow diagram  

This is a portfolio project created for demonstration purposes only. For real integration, please refer to the official [Stripe API docs](https://stripe.com/docs/api).
